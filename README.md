# Water Bear Games

This is the theme for the [Water Bear Games website](http://waterbeargames.com/). We also use this repository's Github issues for Water Bear Games projects in general.

### History of the Water Bear Games site
- First it was straight HTML/CSS.
- Second version WordPressified the first version. The look of the site stayed essentially the same, except I made it more responsive.
- As for the third version...
  - The first version of the third version was never live anywhere. I changed the look entirely, but never actually "designed" the site. I was just making up the look as I coded, left it alone for months, came back to it, and decided it was unsatifactory.
  - The second version of the third version (lol), I actually set aside time to design it instead of designing as an afterthought, and I'm a lot happier with it. I've also become a better developer, and incorporated my [Puzzle Pieces](https://github.com/Caraheacock/puzzle_pieces) framework.

Yaaaay.
